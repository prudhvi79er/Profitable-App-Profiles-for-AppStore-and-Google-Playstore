# Profitable-App-Profiles-for-AppStore-and-Google-Playstore
Mock Profit Analysis using only Python Lists and Dictionaries

Our aim is to find mobile apps that are profitable in App Store and Google Play. This mock project will help a team of developers to make data-driven decisions on what apps to build. As a company we only build free to install apps,so our main source of revenue is in-app ads. This means our revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users that use the app. The goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what kind of apps are more likely to attract users.
